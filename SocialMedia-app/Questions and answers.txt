Interviewer: Can you explain how you handle file uploads in your application to avoid filename conflicts?

You: Certainly! In my application, we handle file uploads by ensuring that each file is stored with a unique filename to prevent conflicts. We achieve this by using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) when saving the files on the server.

Interviewer: Why did you choose to use UUIDs for this purpose?

You: UUIDs provide a way to generate unique identifiers that are statistically guaranteed to be unique across all space and time. This makes them ideal for situations where we need to avoid filename collisions. By using UUIDs, we ensure that even if multiple users upload files with the same original name, they will be stored with unique names on the server.

Interviewer: How did you implement this?

You: In the backend, we use a library like uuid to generate a UUID for each file upload. Hereâ€™s a snippet of the implementation:

const multer = require('multer');
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');
const path = require('path');

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, 'public/images');
    },
    filename: (req, file, cb) => {
        const uniqueName = uuidv4() + path.extname(file.originalname);
        cb(null, uniqueName);
    }
});

const upload = multer({ storage });

app.post('/api/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
    try {
        const uniqueName = req.file.filename;
        return res.status(200).json({ message: 'File has been uploaded', fileName: uniqueName });
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
        res.status(500).json('File upload failed');
    }
});

Interviewer: What benefits does this approach offer?

You: This approach ensures that every file is uniquely named, preventing any overwriting or conflicts that might occur if users upload files with the same name. It also simplifies the file management process, as we can always be confident that each file name is unique. Moreover, using UUIDs is a lightweight and efficient method that integrates well with existing file handling libraries like multer.
